# Introduction

My topic is about people's credit-related information. I will focus on building a machine learning model that is intelligent enough to segregate the people into score brackets and classify the credit score. It is problematic to accurately analyze the factors affecting credit and I will try my best to design an ancurate model.

When hiring a new employee, employers usually need to know exactly what the new employee's credit is, and employers will not choose to hire someone with low credit levels. Manually investigating this information is usually labor-intensive, so it is necessary to design a universal credit scoring system for corporate hiring.

In the training dataset, many credit-related variables are involved, such as the number of credit cards, number of bank accounts and number of loans, etc. I will systematically analyze these variables and the relationship between them, drawing graphs to show the levels of each variable.

Having good credit means that you are making regular payments on time, on each of your accounts, until your balance is paid in full. Alternately, bad credit means you have had a hard time holding up your end of the bargain; you may not have paid the full minimum payments or not made payments on time.
Understanding and maintaining your credit is a key component of living comfortably. Keeping an eye on your credit score and taking steps to improve your score wherever you can are good habits that help ensure you can borrow money when you need to make a large purchase.

Your credit profile can influence your chances of qualifying for loans and credit cards. Most people know that. But it can also play a role in decisions made by insurance companies, landlords, utilities and employers, too. Your credit history is an indication of how you’ve managed debt in the past, and many companies use it to predict your future financial behaviors. So when you apply to do things like borrow money, get a credit card or rent an apartment, your credit history may be looked at.

Good credit scores may suggest you’re responsible and practice good financial habits, like paying your bills on time. But low credit scores may give the opposite impression.
There’s no one-size-fits-all way to know how credit is judged. But the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau offers some ways you can build good credit. And Capital One has six tips about using credit cards responsibly that may be helpful, too.

**Ten questions I want to solve.**

1. Why is credit classification important?

2. How to accrately quantify credit in this context?

3. How to clean this dataset?

4. What kind of methods of machine learning are going to be used?

5. How to evaluate results?

6. What should be included in EDA of data?

7. Which machine learning method best classify the dataset?

8. Can I make a brief comparison between the results of different ML methods?

9. How to ensure the importance of all the features?

10. How do I conclude my work by doing data analysis?
